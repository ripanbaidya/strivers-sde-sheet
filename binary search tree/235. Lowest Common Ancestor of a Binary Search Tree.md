## Description
Given a Binary search tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

**Examples**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/14/binarysearchtree_improved.png)

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

Example 2:
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
- -109 <= Node.val <= 109
- All Node.val are unique.
- p != q
- p and q will exist in the tree.


## [Expected Approach] Using Single Traversal – O(n) Time and O(h) Space

The idea is to traverse the tree starting from the root. If any of the given keys (n1 and n2) matches with the root, then the root is LCA (assuming that both keys are present). If the root doesn’t match with any of the keys, we recur for the left and right subtree. The node which has one key present in its left subtree and the other key present in the right subtree is the LCA, else if, both keys lie in the left subtree, then the left subtree has LCA, else the LCA lies in the right subtree. 

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if (root == null || root == p || root == q) {
            // If the root is null or either of the two nodes, return the root
            return root;
        }

        // Recursively search for the two nodes in the left subtree
        TreeNode left = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);

        // Recursively search for the two nodes in the right subtree
        TreeNode right = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

        // If the left subtree contains one of the nodes, return the left subtree
        if (left == null) {
            return right;
        } 
        // If the right subtree contains one of the nodes, return the right subtree
        else if (right == null) {
            return left;
        } 
        // If both subtrees contain one of the nodes, return the current root
        else {
            return root;
        }
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity** : `O(h)`



## Using BST Properties (Iterative Method) – O(h) Time and O(1) Space

The auxiliary space in the above method can be optimized by eliminating recursion. Below is the iterative implementation of this approach.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        TreeNode currentNode = root;
        while (currentNode != null) {
            if (currentNode.val > p.val && currentNode.val > q.val) {
                // Both p and q are less than the current node, so move left
                currentNode = currentNode.left;
            } else if (currentNode.val < p.val && currentNode.val < q.val) {
                // Both p and q are greater than the current node, so move right
                currentNode = currentNode.right;
            } else {
                // The current node is the lowest common ancestor, so break
                break;
            }
        }
        return currentNode;
    }
}
```
