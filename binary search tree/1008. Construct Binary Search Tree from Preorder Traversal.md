## Description
Given an array of integers preorder, which represents the preorder traversal of a BST (i.e., binary search tree), construct the tree and return its root.

It is guaranteed that there is always possible to find a binary search tree with the given requirements for the given test cases.

A binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of Node.left has a value strictly less than Node.val, and any descendant of Node.right has a value strictly greater than Node.val.

A preorder traversal of a binary tree displays the value of the node first, then traverses Node.left, then traverses Node.right.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: preorder = [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

Example 2:
Input: preorder = [1,3]
Output: [1,null,3]
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
- 1 <= preorder[i] <= 1000
- All the values of preorder are unique.


## [Naive Approach] One by One Insert

### Intution

The idea is, for each value we will create a node and will try to insert the node at its correct place in the BST. for this we will traverse through the `preorder` and in each iteration will create a node and will try to place that node to its correct place.

### Complexity Analsysis
- **Time Compelxity** : `O(n ^ 2)`
  - `O(n)` : if there are n number of nodes
  - `O(n)` : to place each node to its correct place. 
- **Space Complexity** : `O(n)`


## [Efficient Approach] - Pass Range in Recursion 

### Intution
The Intution is we will use a `upperbound` concept in order to place each node to its correct place. while inserting node we will check the upperbound and will verity whether a node is possible to place at a particular position. for left node we will pass the current value as the `upperbound` and for the right node we will pass the `upperbound` as it is and this will go until we reach end of `preorder` array.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    private int[] index = new int[]{0};
    private int[] preorder;

    public TreeNode bstFromPreorder(int[] preorder) {
        this.preorder = preorder;
        return build(Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }

    private TreeNode build(int upperBound) {
        // Base case: if index has reached end of array, return null
        if (index[0] == preorder.length || preorder[index[0]] > upperBound) {
            return null;
        }

        // Create a new TreeNode with the current value
        TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode(preorder[index[0]++]);

        // Recursively build the left subtree
        newNode.left = build(newNode.val);

        // Recursively build the right subtree
        newNode.right = build(upperBound);

        return newNode;
    }
}
```
