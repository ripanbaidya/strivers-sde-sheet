## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST).

A valid BST is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [2,1,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [5,1,4,null,null,3,6]
Output: false
Explanation: The root node's value is 5 but its right child's value is 4.
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
- -231 <= Node.val <= 231 - 1

## [Approach – 1] Using specified range of Min and Max Values – O(n) Time and O(h) Space
```
The idea is to use a recursive helper function, isBSTUtil(node, min, max) to check whether a subtree (rooted at a given node) is a binary search tree (BST) within a specified range of minimum (min) and maximum (max) values. If it falls outside this range, it violates BST properties, so we return false. 


For the left subtree, we call isBSTUtil() with the updated range as the max is set to (node->data – 1 ) because all values in the left subtree must be smaller than the current node’s value.
For the right subtree, we call isBSTUtil() with the updated range as the min is set to (node->data + 1) because all values in the right subtree must be greater than the current node’s value.
Both recursive calls must return true for the entire subtree to be a valid BST.
``` 

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    private boolean isValidBst(TreeNode root, long min, long max) {
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }

        if (root.val <= min || root.val >= max) {
            return false;
        }

        return isValidBst(root.left, min, root.val) && isValidBst(root.right, root.val, max);
    }

    public boolean isValidBst(TreeNode root) {
        // Use Long.MIN_VALUE and Long.MAX_VALUE to avoid overflow
        return isValidBst(root, Long.MIN_VALUE, Long.MAX_VALUE);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity** : `O(h)`, where h is the height of the tree, due to recursive calls (worst case O(n) for a skewed tree, `O(log n)` for a balanced tree).
