## Description
You are given an m x n integer array grid. There is a robot initially located at the top-left corner (i.e., grid[0][0]). The robot tries to move to the bottom-right corner (i.e., grid[m - 1][n - 1]). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

An obstacle and space are marked as 1 or 0 respectively in grid. A path that the robot takes cannot include any square that is an obstacle.

Return the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner.

The testcases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to 2 * 109.

**Example 1**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/04/robot1.jpg)

```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right
```

**Example 2**
```
Input: obstacleGrid = [[0,1],[0,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == obstacleGrid.length`
- `n == obstacleGrid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `obstacleGrid[i][j] is 0 or 1.`


## Using Recursion â€“ O(2^(n+m)) Time and O(n+m) Space  
 
### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int count(int row, int col, int[][] grid){
        // base case 1: path found
        if(row == 0 && col == 0 && grid[row][col] != 1)
            return 1;
        // base case 2: invalid grid
        if(row < 0 || col < 0)
            return 0;
        
        // for top-down approach only left and top
        // moves are allowed.
        int left = 0, top = 0;

        if(grid[row][col] != 1)
            left = count(row, col-1, grid);
        
        if(grid[row][col] != 1)
            top = count(row-1, col, grid);

        return left + top;
    }
    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;

        
        return count(m-1, n-1, obstacleGrid);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(2^(m+n))`
  - Each cell can branch into two recursive calls (move right or down), leading to exponential growth.
  
- **Space Complexity** : `O(m+n)`
  - The maximum depth of the recursion stack is m + n (the longest path from top-left to bottom-right).




## Using Top-Down DP (Memoization) - O(m*n) Time and O(m*n) Space  
 
### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int count(int row, int col, int[][] grid, int[][] dp){
        // Base cases
        if(row < 0 || col < 0) return 0; // Out of bounds
        if(grid[row][col] == 1) return 0; // Obstacle found
        if(row == 0 && col == 0) return 1; // Path found

        // If the subproblem has already been solved, return the cached result.
        if(dp[row][col] != -1)
            return dp[row][col];

        // Recursive case: move either left or top
        int left = count(row, col-1, grid, dp);
        int top = count(row-1, col, grid, dp);

        // Cache the result before returning it.
        return dp[row][col] = left + top;
    }

    public int uniquePathsWithObstacles(int[][] obstacleGrid) {
        int m = obstacleGrid.length;
        int n = obstacleGrid[0].length;

        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        Arrays.stream(dp).forEach(row -> Arrays.fill(row, -1)); // Initialize with -1

        return count(m-1, n-1, obstacleGrid, dp);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(m*n)`
  - Each state (row, col) is computed only once and stored in the DP table.

- **Space Complexity** : `O(m*n)`
  - For the DP table plus recursion stack (which is at most O(m+n) but dominated by the DP table).
