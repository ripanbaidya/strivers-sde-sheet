## Description

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appears only once.

Your solution must run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`


## [Naive Approach 1] By comparing adjacent elements – O(n) Time and O(1) Space
- The single element must appear at an odd position (or even index) because every other element appears twice.
- One by one check all odd postilions (or even indexes) and if we find an element which is not same as next, we return the element.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // Since every other element appears twice,
        // the single element must be at an odd
        // position
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i += 2) {
            if (nums[i] != nums[i + 1]) {
                return nums[i];
            }
        }

        // If no element found, the 
        // single element must be 
        // the last one
        return nums[n - 1];
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` 
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  

## [Naive Approach 2] Using Bitwise XOR – O(n) Time and O(1) Space
We can use the properties of XOR (a ^ a = 0 & a ^ 0 = a) to find the element that occurs once. The idea is to find the XOR of the complete array, so all the elements which occur twice will have their XOR = 0 and the XOR of the array will be the required answer.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int XOR = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            XOR ^= arr[i];
        }
        return XOR;        
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as we use only a constant amount of extra space.


## [Expected Approach] Using Binary Search – O(log n) Time and O(1) Space

### Intuition
Given a sorted array in ascending order where every element appears exactly twice except for one unique element, we need to efficiently find this single element. 

**Key Observations:**
1. **Left Half Pattern**: Before the single element, pairs of elements follow the pattern where the first instance is at an even index and the second instance is at the next odd index. For example, in `[1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]`, pairs like `(1,1)` are at indices `(0,1)`.
2. **Right Half Pattern**: After the single element, this pattern shifts—the first instance of a pair is at an odd index, and the second instance is at the next even index. For example, in `[3,3,7,7,10,11,11]`, the pair `(11,11)` is at indices `(5,6)`.

Our goal is to identify the point where this pattern breaks, which indicates the position of the single element.

### Algorithm
1. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - Initialize `low = 0` and `high = nums.length - 2`. We set `high` to `nums.length - 2` to avoid index out-of-bounds errors when checking pairs, especially when the single element is at the end of the array.
2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - Compute `mid` as the middle index between `low` and `high`.
   - Check if `nums[mid]` and `nums[mid ^ 1]` form a valid pair (i.e., `nums[mid] == nums[mid ^ 1]`). The XOR operation (`mid ^ 1`) toggles the least significant bit of `mid`, ensuring we check the adjacent index in the pair:
     - If `mid` is even, `mid ^ 1` gives `mid + 1` (the next odd index).
     - If `mid` is odd, `mid ^ 1` gives `mid - 1` (the previous even index).
   - If the pair is valid (`nums[mid] == nums[mid ^ 1]`), the single element must be in the right half. Move `low = mid + 1`.
   - If the pair is invalid, the single element must be in the left half. Move `high = mid - 1`.
3. **Termination**:
   - The loop terminates when `low` exceeds `high`, at which point `nums[low]` is the single element.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int singleNonDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.length - 2; // high to size-2 to avoid overflow issue

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) >> 1; // calculate mid
            if (nums[mid] == nums[mid ^ 1]) { // Check if mid and its pair form a valid pair
                low = mid + 1; // Move to the right half
            } else {
                high = mid - 1; // Move to the left half
            }
        }
        return nums[low]; // The single element is at low
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` due to binary search, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` as we use only a constant amount of extra space.
