## Description
Given the root of a binary tree, return the length of the diameter of the tree.

The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

The length of a path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.

**Examples**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/06/diamtree.jpg)

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is the length of the path [4,2,1,3] or [5,2,1,3].

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
- -100 <= Node.val <= 100


## [Expected Approach] Using Bottom Up Recursive â€“ O(n) Time and O(h) Space

The idea is to optimize the above approach by calculating the height in the same recursive function rather than calculating it separately.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode root) {
        int[] diameter = new int[1];

        calculateHeight(root, diameter);

        return diameter[0];
    }

    private int calculateHeight(TreeNode root, int[] diameter) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int leftHeight = calculateHeight(root.left, diameter);
        int rightHeight = calculateHeight(root.right, diameter);

        int currentDiameter = leftHeight + rightHeight;
        diameter[0] = Math.max(diameter[0], currentDiameter);

        return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity** : `O(h)`
