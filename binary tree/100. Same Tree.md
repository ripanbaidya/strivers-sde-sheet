## Description
Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

**Examples**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/20/ex1.jpg)

```
Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104


## [Expected Approach] Using DFS – O(n) Time and O(n) Space
```
The idea is to compare the root nodes’ data and recursively verify that their left and right subtrees are identical. Both trees must have the same structure and data at each corresponding node.
```

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean areTreesIdentical(TreeNode tree1, TreeNode tree2) {
        // If both trees are null, they are identical
        if (tree1 == null && tree2 == null) return true;
        
        // If only one of the trees is null, they are not identical
        if (tree1 == null || tree2 == null) return false;

        // If the current nodes' values are not equal, the trees are not identical
        if (tree1.val != tree2.val) return false;
        
        // Recursively check if the left and right subtrees are identical
        return areTreesIdentical(tree1.left, tree2.left) && areTreesIdentical(tree1.right, tree2.right);
    }
}
```

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(n)`
- **Space Complexity** : `O(n)`
