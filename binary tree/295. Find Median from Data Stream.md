## Description
The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is the mean of the two middle values.

* For example, for arr = [2,3,4], the median is 3.
* For example, for arr = [2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

Implement the MedianFinder class:

* MedianFinder() initializes the MedianFinder object.
* void addNum(int num) adds the integer num from the data stream to the data structure.
* double findMedian() returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
 
```
Example 1:

Input
["MedianFinder", "addNum", "addNum", "findMedian", "addNum", "findMedian"]
[[], [1], [2], [], [3], []]
Output
[null, null, null, 1.5, null, 2.0]

Explanation
MedianFinder medianFinder = new MedianFinder();
medianFinder.addNum(1);    // arr = [1]
medianFinder.addNum(2);    // arr = [1, 2]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 1.5 (i.e., (1 + 2) / 2)
medianFinder.addNum(3);    // arr[1, 2, 3]
medianFinder.findMedian(); // return 2.0
```

**Constraints:**

- -105 <= num <= 105
- There will be at least one element in the data structure before calling findMedian.
- At most 5 * 104 calls will be made to addNum and findMedian.
 
**Follow up:**

- If all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?
- If 99% of all integer numbers from the stream are in the range [0, 100], how would you optimize your solution?



## [Optimal Approach]
The median of an array occurs at the center of sorted array, so the idea is to store the current elements in two nearly equal parts. A max heap (left half) stores the smaller elements, ensuring the largest among them is at the top, while a min heap (right half) stores the larger elements, keeping the smallest at the top.

For each new element:

1. It is first added to the max heap.
2. The max heapâ€™s top element is moved to the min heap to maintain order.
3. If the min heap has more elements than the max heap, its top element is moved back to ensure balance.

This keeps both halves nearly equal in size, differing by at most one element. If the heaps are balanced, the median is the average of their root values; otherwise, it is the root of the heap with more elements.

### Code
```java
class MedianFinder { // time: O(log n), space: O(1)
    // Max heap to store the smaller half of numbers
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> leftMaxHeap;

    // Min heap to store the greater half of numbers
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> rightMinHeap;

    public MedianFinder() {
        leftMaxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a); 
        rightMinHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(); 
    }
    
    public void addNum(int num) {
        leftMaxHeap.offer(num);

        rightMinHeap.offer(leftMaxHeap.poll());

        if(leftMaxHeap.size() < rightMinHeap.size()){
            leftMaxHeap.offer(rightMinHeap.poll());
        }
    }
    
    // Compute median based on heap sizes
    public double findMedian() {
        if(leftMaxHeap.size() == rightMinHeap.size()) {
            return (leftMaxHeap.peek()+rightMinHeap.peek()) / 2.0;
        } else {
            return leftMaxHeap.peek();
        }
    }
}
```
### Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * log n)`, All the operations within the loop (push, pop) take O(log n) time in the worst case for a heap of size n.
- **Auxiliary Space**: `O(n)`
