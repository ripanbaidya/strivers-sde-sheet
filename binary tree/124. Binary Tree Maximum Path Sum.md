## Description
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any non-empty path.


**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

```
Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 104].
- -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

## [Maximum Path Sum in a Binary Tree] Using Recursion â€“ O(n) Time and O(h) Space

### Approach

If the maximum sum path in a binary tree passes through the root, there are four possible cases to consider:

1. The path consists only the root itself, without involving any children.
2. The path starts at the root and extends downward through its right child, possibly continuing to the bottom of the right subtree.
3. The path starts at the root and extends downward through its left child, possibly continuing the bottom of the left subtree.
4. The path includes the root and spans both the left and right children.

The idea is to keep track of all four paths for each subtree of the tree and pick up the max one in the end. 

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    // Stores the maximum path sum of the binary tree.
    private int maxPathSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

    // Computes the maximum path sum recursively.
    private int computeMaxPathSum(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Compute the maximum path sum for the left and right subtrees
        int leftPathSum = Math.max(0, computeMaxPathSum(node.left));
        int rightPathSum = Math.max(0, computeMaxPathSum(node.right));

        // Update the maximum path sum
        maxPathSum = Math.max(maxPathSum, node.val + leftPathSum + rightPathSum);

        // Return the maximum path sum ending at the given node
        return node.val + Math.max(leftPathSum, rightPathSum);
    }

    // Computes the maximum path sum of the binary tree.
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        computeMaxPathSum(root);
        
        return maxPathSum;
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(n)`, where n is the number of nodes in the Binary Tree.
- **Space Complexity** : `O(h)`, where h is the height of the tree.
