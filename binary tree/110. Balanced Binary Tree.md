## Description
Given a binary tree, determine if it is <i><u>height-balanced</u></i>

`A height-balanced binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one.`

**Examples**

![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_1.jpg)

```
Example 1:
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: root = []
Output: true 
```

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
- -104 <= Node.val <= 104


## [Approach 1] Using Recursion â€“ O(n) Time and O(h) Space

The problem requires determining whether a binary tree is height-balanced. A tree is considered height-balanced if, for every node, the difference in height between its left and right subtrees is at most 1.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    private int calculateHeight(TreeNode node, boolean[] isBalanced) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int leftHeight = calculateHeight(node.left, isBalanced);
        int rightHeight = calculateHeight(node.right, isBalanced);

        // if already false don't overrite it.
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            isBalanced[0] = false;
        }

        return 1 + Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight);
    }

    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        boolean[] isBalanced = {true}; // default to true;
        calculateHeight(root, isBalanced);

        return isBalanced[0];
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexiy** : `O(N)`, Each node is visited once to calculate its height.
- **Space Complexity** : `O(H)`, Due to the recursion stack, where H is the height of the tree.
