## Description
Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the kth largest element in the array.

Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Can you solve it without sorting?

**Examples**

```
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2:
Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
``` 

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
- -104 <= nums[i] <= 104


## [Expected Approach] Using Priority Queue(Min-Heap) - O(n * log(K)) time and O(K) space
The idea is to maintain a min-heap (priority queue) of size K while iterating through the array. This approach ensures that the heap always contains the K largest elements encountered so far. As we add elements to the heap:

If the size of the heap exceeds K, we remove the smallest element. This ensures that the heap maintains only the K largest elements.
By the end of the process, the top element of the min-heap (which is the smallest of the K largest elements) will be the k-th largest element in the array.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int findKthLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Min heap to store K largest elements
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        // Iterate through the array elements
        for (int val : arr) {
          
            // Add current element to the min heap
            pq.add(val);
            // If heap exceeds size K, remove smallest element
            if (pq.size() > K)
                pq.poll();
        }

        // Top of the heap is the K'th largest element
        return pq.peek();
    }
}
```

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity** : `O(n log k)`, Each insertion and removal operation in a heap takes O(log(K)), and we perform this operation n times for the array.
- **Space Complexity** : `O(k)`, The heap stores at most K elements at a time.
